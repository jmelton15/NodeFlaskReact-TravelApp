<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

How To use App Goes Here.....

## Reasons Behind API Choice and Site Ideas

I opted to use Google Maps as my mapping API because of their nearby_places integration and depth. I have limited the number of trips users can make 
in order to prevent making too many requests to Google since it can become a non-free entity at that point. 

I added in the travel journal idea because my goal is for this app to be a social place for travelers and to maybe promote traveling around more! I would like to include a phone authentication service to allow a secure way to store travel documents and things 

<!-- DATA STORAGE AND SAFETY -->
## Data Storage And Safety

Everything that is stored to be used later is encrypted and secured while stored. This includes anything from password,email,travel forms, to all the locations from your trips. Decoding alogorithms are in places to bring back the stored data to be used
on the client side when asked by that specific user. I may have went a little overboard with the encryption even, but it was fun to learn and good practice! However, I may get rid of the encrypting of the locations from trips as that takes time and may not be needed since registered users can see these anyways.
